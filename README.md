Kindress ========

I like reading on my Kindle. My Kindle doesn't support RSS in a convenient
e-book format, it's always some "digest" mode that frankly get in the way of
what I want to do.

So I built a super-simple RSS-to-MOBI converter that can be setup to run with
cron on a set time every day, week, month or combination.

This is the basic engine which requires some tuning for each setup, but I'm
working on a web service for those that don't want to run this on their own
server and hack it to work for them, but that is a future problem. :^)

My best- /v.
